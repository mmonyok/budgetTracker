## Description
- This app solves the problem of when you are without internet service but are still making bank transactions. 
- You will still be able to mark your transactions down to keep track of your finances; once you are back online, everything you marked offline will be added to the online database.
- I learned a lot of information on IndexedDB and how to integrate it into a web application.
